# **App Name**: ALLY

## Core Features:

- Artwork Identification: Identify artworks from user-uploaded images using image recognition. Users can upload images of artworks, and the app will identify the artwork and provide information about it.
- Personalized Tour Generation: Generate personalized museum tours based on user interests and available time. The app will ask users about their interests and the amount of time they have, and it will generate a tour that is tailored to their needs. An LLM will act as tool to choose a path for the user within the museum.
- Interactive Museum Map: Display an interactive museum map with real-time user location and artwork locations. The map will allow users to easily navigate the museum and find the artworks they are interested in.
- Artwork Information Display: Display detailed information about artworks, including title, artist, description, and location.
- AR Experience Trigger: Trigger augmented reality experiences for selected artworks. When the user is near an artwork with an AR experience, the app will trigger the experience and allow the user to interact with the artwork in a new way.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep crimson (#8B0000) to evoke a sense of history, importance, and artistic richness.
- Background color: Pale blush (#FAEBD7) to provide a soft, neutral backdrop that enhances the artwork.
- Accent color: Muted gold (#B8860B) to highlight key interactive elements.
- Headline font: 'Playfair', a modern serif for an elegant, fashionable, high-end feel. Body font: 'PT Sans' sans-serif, a humanist sans-serif to be paired with Playfair.
- Use refined and minimalist icons that subtly complement the overall aesthetic. Icons should use the muted gold accent color.
- Clean, spacious layouts that allow the artwork to take center stage. Utilize white space effectively to avoid clutter.
- Subtle, elegant transitions and animations to enhance user engagement without being distracting. For instance, a gentle fade-in effect when displaying artwork information.
